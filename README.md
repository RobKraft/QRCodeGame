# QRCodeGame
This project provides all the code you need to make a little game that conference attendees can play on their phones.  When people scan a QR code on a poster you have placed in the venue, the code will run a specific javascript function on the page letting the person know what happened.  In the initial example, when a certain QR code is scanned, the app may respond with, "You found a sword!".

All of the source code for this application is in the single GameOne.html file.  This is intentional in order to make it very simple to understand, copy, and share.  The javascript in the .html is broken into three sections.  Helper Functions, which probably will not need to edit.  App Framework Functions, which also probably do not need to be edited.  And finally, the Game Flow Functions.  You will probably want to modify the Game Flow Functions to customize the app for your own purposes.
No back end server is required.  The app uses the localstorage of the browser to keep track of what actions the player has taken.  The app does not support older browsers.
In the basic first example, GameOne.html, there are 7 possible actions, thus 7 barcodes need to be created for the site.  You will need to identify what the URL will be for the site, such as https://www.rpgkc.org/GameOne.html, and then create 7 bar codes with 7 different URLs like: https://www.rpgkc.org/GameOne.html?action=lo9ikju7yhgt  and https://www.rpgkc.org/GameOne.html?action=6u7ytgfrdews.
I intentionlly chose cryptic action names to keep more savvy players from easily replacing the action with something more simple like "Sword", "Dragon", or "1" and "2".  In the javascript, you match each of the codes to an action that is easier for you, the programmer, to understand.
To assist developers with modifying and debugging the application, you can add an additional parameter &btns=show to the URL in order to see buttons that simulate what the QR codes do; as well as an activity history of each action taken.

GameOne.html uses dialog prompts to provide messages to users.  I found that a little annoying.
GameTwo.html shows messages in a label on the form.  Other than that, it works the same as GameOne.html
